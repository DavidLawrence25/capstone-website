				<h4>Mathematics</h4>
				<p>I've been very interested with maths for years, and I decided in the summer of 2021 to begin studying calculus. Most people would tell you that calculus is insanely difficult, but in truth, it isn't all that complicated once you take the leap of faith. One of the first actually difficult problems was the integral below, which I ended up consulting the Math StackExchange community about. The solution is not terribly impressive, but it's my favorite integral so far because of the great memories I gained from solving it.</p>
				<div class="mathStuff">
					$$2\int_0^1{\sqrt{\sqrt{x}-x}dx}$$
					<hr>
					Start with a simple u-substitution...
					$$u:=\sqrt{x}$$
					$$x=u^2\implies dx=2udu$$
					$$x=0\implies u=0^2=0$$
					$$x=1\implies u=1^2=1$$
					<hr>
					$$4\int_0^1{u\sqrt{u-u^2}du}$$
					To deal with the radical, we will complete the square...
					$$4\int_0^1{u\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}-\left(u^2-u+\frac{1}{4}\right)}du}$$
					$$4\int_0^1{u\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}-\left(u-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}du}$$
					$$2\int_0^1{u\sqrt{1-4\left(u-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}du}$$
					$$2\int_0^1{u\sqrt{1-(2u-1)^2}du}$$
					<hr>
					Unfortunately, we will need to perform a trig substitution...
					$$\sin{\theta}:=2u-1\implies \cos{\theta}d\theta=2du\implies du=\frac{\cos{\theta}d\theta}{2}$$
					$$u=0\implies \sin{\theta}=-1\implies \theta=-\frac{\pi}{2}$$
					$$u=1\implies \sin{\theta}=1\implies \theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$$
					<hr>
					$$\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\left(\frac{1+\sin{\theta}}{2}\right)(\cos{\theta})\sqrt{1-\sin^2{\theta}}d\theta}$$
					With trig functions, we can play around with some identities and split up the integral into two easier ones...
					$$\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{(1+\sin{\theta})(\cos^2{\theta})d\theta}$$
					$$\frac{1}{2}\left[\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\cos^2{\theta}d\theta}+\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\sin{\theta}\cos^2{\theta}d\theta}\right]$$
					Notice that \(\cos^2{\theta}\) is an even function and that it is being integrated on a symmetric interval. Because of this, we can cut the interval in half and multiply the whole integral by 2.
					$$\frac{1}{2}\left[2\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\cos^2{\theta}d\theta}+\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\sin{\theta}\cos^2{\theta}d\theta}\right]$$
					Also notice that \(\sin{\theta}\cos^2{\theta}\) is an odd function and that it is being integrated on a symmetric interval. These types of integrals evaluate to 0, so we can eliminate this one entirely.
					$$\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\cos^2{\theta}d\theta}$$
					$$\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{(1+\cos{2\theta})d\theta}$$
					$$\frac{1}{2}\left[\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{d\theta}+\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\cos{2\theta}d\theta}\right]$$
					$$\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\cos{2\theta}d\theta}$$
					<hr>
					This last integral needs one more substitution to finish up...
					$$\alpha:=2\theta$$
					$$\theta=\frac{\alpha}{2}\implies d\theta=\frac{d\alpha}{2}$$
					$$\theta=0\implies \alpha=0$$
					$$\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}\implies \alpha=\pi$$
					<hr>
					$$\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{1}{4}\int_0^{\pi}{\cos{\alpha}d\alpha}$$
					$$\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{1}{4}[\sin{\pi}-\sin{0}]=\frac{\pi}{4}$$
					<hr>
					$$2\int_0^1{\sqrt{\sqrt{x}-x}dx}=\frac{\pi}{4}$$

				<h4>Programming</h4>
				<div class="flexTable">
					<p style="width: 57vw; font-size: 1.8vw;">Writing code has always been rather interesting for me, particularly when mixed with difficult math problems. I have yet to completely learn any particular language, but I know a decent amount of C, C++, Javascript, Python, HTML, CSS, and JSON. While building my Capstone Project, I hope to become skilled in writing clean and efficient C# code for the Unity game engine.</p>

				<h4>Gaming</h4>
				<div class="flexTable">
					<p style="width: 64vw; font-size: 1.8vw;">On the off chance I have a minute to relax, playing some casual video games is a great way to unwind. I would never consider myself to be skilled in any of the games I play, but I enjoy them nevertheless. One of my personal favorites at the moment is Minecraft, which you have almost certainly heard of. I've been playing since late 2020, and in that time, I have managed to build a handful of interesting redstone contraptions and pleasant aesthetic builds. Last summer, I hosted a small server with two of my friends that was focused on the three dimensions the game has to offer. This gave me an opportunity to program an add-on to enhance the experience, and it ended up going pretty well. The pack was oriented around changes that felt like they could be official features that fit in with the original style of the game. One of my personal favorites was an item called the <em>Sagacious Staff</em>, which served a few purposes. First, it could instantly mine glass, which isn't currently possible in the base game. Second, it shoots Ender Pearls at a higher velocity than normal at the cost of durability. Third and most importantly, it allowed the player to extract experience from the XP Transfer Table. When I get a moment to finish the add-on, I hope to release it to the public as a stand-alone data pack.</p>
