					<h4>1. Pass AP&reg; Biology With an A</h4>
					<div class="flexTable">
						<p style="width: 50vw; font-size: 1.8vw; text-align: right;">I began this course this year, and it's been the single-hardest class I have ever taken. I realized too late that I did not need to take it, so I am in it for the long haul. AP&reg; Bio requires rigorous and devoted work both in the classroom and out, along with a very substantial grasp of basic chemistry and advanced molecular biology. The AP&reg; exam is coming on May 10, 2023, and my hope is that I can get a 3 or above on the test. My performance so far has been quite extraordinary, but this goal will take dedicated practice and intensive study to achieve. Along with that, getting an A is extremely important to me.</p>

					<h4 style="text-align: right; margin-right: 5vw;">2. Be Accepted into the Early College Program</h4>

						<p style="width: 50vw; font-size: 1.8vw;">One of the major reasons I came to NUAMES is the opportunity to be a legitimate college student at Weber State University while I am still in high school. As it turns out, through this program, it is completely possible to earn an Associate's Degree before receiving a diploma. As I write this, I am undergoing the process of getting into the program, and it is my hope that I can be admitted in time for the Autumn 2023 semester. Part of this goal will also be to discover what career pathway I wish to pursue, as that is not completely clear at the present moment. Whatever it ends up being, it will likely be related to maths and/or computer science.</p>

					<h4>3. Become an Experienced Driver</h4>
					<div class="flexTable">
						<p style="width: 50vw; font-size: 1.8vw; text-align: right;">As a teenager, something I need to develop is my ability to drive a car. I have been old enough to drive for a while now, but school has thrown a wrench in my practice and kept me from getting my hours in. Thus, I hope to find the time to build my experience behind the wheel and become a responsive and respectable driver; however, I likely will not receive my driver's license for a few more years because car insurance for minors is quite expensive. Additionally, it wouldn't benefit me to have a license at this time due to the absurd price of campus parking passes.</p>

					<h4>1. Graduate High School with an Overall 4.0 GPA</h4>
					<div class="flexTable">

						<p style="width: 50vw; font-size: 2vw;">High school is far from an easy task, no matter what your background is. Not only is our education system completely hostile towards children, but it encourages us to remove ourselves from any social life we may have had before. This is particularly true for students at NUAMES, where most came alone and are currently burnt out from the load. So far, I have managed to maintain a 4.0 GPA throughout middle and high school, and I would like to continue that trend into the five remaining semesters.</p>

					<h4>2. Complete my Capstone Project</h4>
					<div class="flexTable">
						<p style="width: 50vw; font-size: 1.7vw; text-align: right;">Unlike most other high schools I know of, NUAMES requires its students to complete a Senior Capstone Project to graduate. These can be a number of things, but the most fascinating type is Academic Inquiry. NUAMES defines this as "a demonstration of learning/knowledge from a WSU or NUAMES course. This could be an extension of a course project, creative work, research, or participation in a competition, etc." I have not decided on what exactly my project will be, but I believe this is the route I wish to go for. Whatever it ends up being, I must finish before the presentation during my senior year.</p>

					<h4>3. Contribute to an Unsolved Math Problem</h4>
					<div class="flexTable">

						<img src="images/Math.jpg" alt="Mathematical Equation Written on Blackboard" style="width: 40vw; border-radius: 3%;">
						<p style="width: 50vw; font-size: 1.8vw;">In the mathematical community, there are a set of problems we have yet to find the solution to. Some problems are so important to us that they even carry bounties worth a million dollars. One such problem is the Riemann Hypothesis, which states that all nontrivial zeroes of the complex zeta function have a real part of 0.5. A common theme with all these problems, as you may have noticed, is that they require immense background knowledge to even comprehend the question at hand. I am far from qualified to explain the setup for the Riemann Hypothesis, but I hope to one day contribute to the eventual solution. If it is not this one, I would like to help with another problem that may hold real-world value.</p>
