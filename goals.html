					<h4>1. Pass AP&reg; Biology With an A</h4>
					<div class="flexTable">
						<p style="width: 50vw; font-size: 1.8vw; text-align: right;">I began this course this year, and it's been the single-hardest class I have ever taken. I realized too late that I did not need to take it, so I am in it for the long haul. AP&reg; Bio requires rigorous and devoted work both in the classroom and out, along with a very substantial grasp of basic chemistry and advanced molecular biology. The AP&reg; exam is coming on May 10, 2023, and my hope is that I can get a 3 or above on the test. My performance so far has been quite extraordinary, but this goal will take dedicated practice and intensive study to achieve. Along with that, getting an A is extremely important to me.</p>

						<p style="width: 50vw; font-size: 1.8vw;">One of the major reasons I came to NUAMES is the opportunity to be a legitimate college student at Weber State University while I am still in high school. As it turns out, through this program, it is completely possible to earn an Associate's Degree before receiving a diploma. As I write this, I am undergoing the process of getting into the program, and it is my hope that I can be admitted in time for the Autumn 2023 semester. Part of this goal will also be to discover what career pathway I wish to pursue, as that is not completely clear at the present moment. Whatever it ends up being, it will likely be related to maths and/or computer science.</p>

					<h4>3. Become an Experienced Driver</h4>
					<div class="flexTable">
						<p style="width: 50vw; font-size: 1.8vw; text-align: right;">As a teenager, something I need to develop is my ability to drive a car. I have been old enough to drive for a while now, but school has thrown a wrench in my practice and kept me from getting my hours in. Thus, I hope to find the time to build my experience behind the wheel and become a responsive and respectable driver; however, I likely will not receive my driver's license for a few more years because car insurance for minors is quite expensive. Additionally, it wouldn't benefit me to have a license at this time due to the absurd price of campus parking passes.</p>
